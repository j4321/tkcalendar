tkcalendar is a python module that provides the Calendar and DateEntry widgets for Tkinter.
The DateEntry widget is similar to a Combobox, but the drop-down is not a list but a Calendar to select a date.
Events can be displayed in the Calendar with custom colors and a tooltip displays the event list for a given day.
tkcalendar is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.
It supports many locale settings (e.g. 'fr_FR', 'en_US', ..) and the colors are customizable.
